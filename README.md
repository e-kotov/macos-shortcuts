# macos-shortcuts

This is a repository with useful shortcuts for MacOS.

- **Grabbing text from a custom screenshot**. This one uses the shell command to initiate screenshot, as the Shortcuts action "Take Screenshot" was broken in macOS 14.5 and who knows when this is fixed. Consider reporting the bug to Apple here [https://www.apple.com/feedback/macos.html](https://www.apple.com/feedback/macos.html). I did.
