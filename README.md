This is a repository with useful shortcuts for macOS.

Currently, it contains shortcuts for:

## [Grab Text from a Custom Screenshot](./shortcut-files/Grab%20Text%20via%20Clipboard%20Screenshot.shortcut)

This action allows you to extract text using macOS built-in text recognition from any area of the screen by taking a custom screenshot.

~This shortcut uses a shell command to initiate the screenshot, as the "Take Screenshot" action was broken in macOS 14.5. If this issue persists, consider reporting the bug to Apple <a href="https://www.apple.com/feedback/macos.html" target="_blank">here</a>. I did.~

This action no longer uses the shell command, as Apple has fixed the issue.

This action allows you to translate any text using macOS built-in text recognition and translation from any area of the screen by taking a custom screenshot.

It is better to have the dictionaries installed (go to System Preferences -> Language & Region -> Translation Languages...).
